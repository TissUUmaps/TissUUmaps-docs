# Exporting screenshots

TissUUmaps allows high resolution capture of the image viewport. Go to `Menu > File > Capture viewport` and chose a zoom factor for export (1 = screen resolution).

The screen capture will contain all filtered layers, markers, and regions. Note that legends will not be part of the export and must be added manually.
