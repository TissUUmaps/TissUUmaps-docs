# Plugins

## Load plugins

## Make your own plugin

Download the Plugin Template python and javascript files from the [Plugin Update Site](https://tissuumaps.github.io/TissUUmaps/plugins/) and put them in your local folder `$USER_PATH/.tissuumaps/plugins/`.

### Javascript file

You can access the javascript API [here](https://tissuumaps.github.io/TissUUmapsCore/).

### Python file

You only need to use the Python file if your plugin needs to do processing on the server side. For pure javascript plugins, you can leave this file empty.
